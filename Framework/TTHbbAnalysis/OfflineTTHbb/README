# OfflineTTHbb

## Introduction

This is an offline L2 code created for use by those running over the output of TTHbbLeptonic ntuples/

It is an interface to the tools built with the TTHbb EDM, and is completely configurable with a text file.

The latest release of TTHbbAnalysis should be checked out for running with this package.

## Usage

To run the code simply do
 * ttH-offline configuration.txt inputs.txt
Or if you wish to change some of the settings in the command line
 * ttH-offline configuration.txt inputs.txt -o SettingName paramater

## Development

The code is still under development and is no doubt missing your favourite feature or a lot of documentation.
